# Introduction
## What is Exchange?
The aim of Exchange was to create an end-to-end digital solution for Payment Facilitators and Marketplaces, and allows for integrations of Merchant onboarding, reporting, risk decisioning and settlements all in the same platform. Exchange offers touchpoints through it's user interface 'Portals' and through API integration.
The PayFac is able to control configuration of the Merchant journey through use of the config portal, and configurations setup are used (such as defaults) for API integration too.
