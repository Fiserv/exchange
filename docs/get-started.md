# Getting Started with Exchange

The developer studio allows users to view and use documentation for Exchange. This is seperated into two sections, the [Documentation](?path=/docs/introduction/exchange-intro.md) and the specs + schema on the [API Explorer](../api/?type=post&path=/boarding/add_application)
