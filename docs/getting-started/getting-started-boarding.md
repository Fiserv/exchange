# Boarding APIs

Exchange allows the creation of applications on the system by using a set of boarding APIs. This is comprised of adding the Registered Legal Business Entity, a Chain (or Subgroup), and DBA locations (Outlets)
Once an application is added, it can be submit to move into downstream systems, and once complete will return with the status 'Boarding complete'. The flow of an application may differ depending on what services on the system are being utlilized.
