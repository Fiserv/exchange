# OAuth

To generate token for authorisation, the 	`/oauth/token/` endpoint may be used, and credentials must be sent as a Basic Auth Header with the request.

# Postman

If testing using postman, the Auth tab can be used to authorise API requests. This can be done by using Auth type Outh 2.0, selecting Grant Type 'Client Credentials', entering the Access Token URL (URL/oauth/token), Client ID as as username an Client secret as pasord and getting new acces token
