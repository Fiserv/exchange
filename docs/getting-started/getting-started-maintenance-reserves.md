# Reserve Maintenance

Reserves can be added to sub-merchants to collect and manage amounts for collateral through Exchange. For Auto-Funding, this can be used to setup a reserve to collect automatically based on settings. For Instructional funding, reserves can be enabled and collected with funding instructions.
Only one maintenance case for reserves on a sub-merchant can be active at a time.
These are split into three cases, to add, amend, or remove a reserve.
