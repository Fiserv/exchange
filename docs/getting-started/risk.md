# Risk services

## Risk services available in Exchange

If using Risk services in Exchange the PayFac will be able enable Credit risk and OFAC Screening, as well as OFAC monitoring for the Merchant. 
The PayFac will be responsible for reviewing any possible matches retrieved at the business and pricinipal levels to ensure that there is not match with the OFAC list. If an OFAC hit is confirmed, the merchant cannot be boarded and if already on the system will be held from funding.
 
## Screening

After intial configurations have be done to setup screening, the PayFac will be able to retrieve reports that are generated during the boarding process for their merchants by API. All previous processes required must have been completed for the application before starting the risk process. 
After retrieving the reports, the PayFac will manually review all potential matches generated by the 3^rd parties. Reports can be confirmed or discounted.
If confirming the report, the PayFac is confirming that the potential match is valid. To discount , means that the potential match in incorrect and does not match the business or principal. For AML, the application will be cancelled if any potential match is confirmed. For Credit risk reports, the user will have to confirm the reports and make the underwriting decision for the application (only available for 'full-service' clients).

### Available OFAC screening API

#### Retrieve intelligence reports available

The `/intelligence/retrieve_intelligence` endpoint can be used to retrieve all avaliable screening reports for a merchant application. This will include the business level, and the principal level. Each entry in the response will return an `entity_reference` to use in the `/intelligence/retrieve_report`.

#### Retrieve intelligence reports

After retrieving the `entity_reference` from  the `/intelligence/retrieve_intelligence` endpoint, the PayFac can then view each report through the `/intelligence/retrieve_report` endpoint.

#### Overwrite intelligence reports

This `/intelligence/overwrite_aml_reports` is used to overwrite OFAC reports for potential matches. The potential matches will need to be confirmed or discounted for the application where these are found. If any applications match it confirmed, the application will have to be cancelled. The user must add a review note for each entity as required.

### Credit risk screening API

## Monitoring

Monitoring must be enabled before the applications are submitted, and the user will not be able to retroactively enable monitoring for an application after it was been boarded. If enabled, the system will monitor merchants every day. The user will be able to make an API call in  order to check if any alert has been raised or material for their merchants has changed. If an alert has been raised, the user can retrieve the reports for this and manually review (like during the screening process).
If an OFAC alert has been raised, the system will automatically *hold* the merchant, meaning that no funding will be able to happen for the merchant. The reviewer will then need to discount all potential matches from the alert. Once discounted, this will automatically unhold the merchant to re-enable funding.
